The `cospex` packages proposes S4 classes for defining, estimating and
simulating observations from the conditional spatio-temporal extremes
(and extensions thereof) of Wadsworth and Tawn. At maturity, it is
expected that the package functionalities will include

-   [ ] `S4` classes for models
-   [x] `S4` classes for scaling functions
-   [ ] predefined scaling functions
-   [ ] maximum likelihood estimation routines
-   [ ] unconditional simulation (forward sampling, importance sampling)
-   [ ] conditional simulations (kriging)
-   [ ] diagnostic plot: lag independence
-   [ ] diagnostic plot: Kendall’s
    ![\tau](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5Ctau "\tau")
-   [ ] utilities: covariance models
-   [ ] utilities: distance with geometric anisotropy
-   [ ] `S4` methods for summary objects
-   [ ] extension: addition of nugget term
-   [ ] marginal transformation to standardized margins (with
    semiparametric transformation and point mass for zero inflation)
-   [ ] left-censoring
-   [ ] unit tests
-   [ ] vignettes
-   [ ] linear combination basis functions with Gaussian weights in
    place of residual Gaussian process (INLA, multiresolution)

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of `cospex` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("cospex") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of \`cospex from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lbelzile/cospex")
```

<!-- `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->
